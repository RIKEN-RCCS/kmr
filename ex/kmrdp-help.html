<h1>Overview of KMR-DP (MPI-DP Compatibility)</h1>

<p>Copyright (C) 2012-2015 RIKEN AICS</p>

<p>(KMR Version: v1.7.1(20150629))</p>

<p>
KMR-DP is a (hopefully better) replacement to a tool MPI-DP for
Ghost/MP, developed by AKIYAMA Lab., Tokyo Institute of Technology
Institute (titec).

<p>
KMR-DP is intended to run master-slave tasks with minimal modification
to the application.  KMR-DP reads tasks in the job-list table and
distributes them to the ranks.  Arguments to the tasks are prepared by
substituting the variables in the template with the entries in the
job-list table.

<h1>Application Changes</h1>

<p>
An application needs to be changed to make the entry point name as
"application".  The "main" is provided by MPI-DP, which sets up the
MPI environment and then calls "application".  The "application" has a
C-linkage.

<pre class="fragment">
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {......}
==>
int application(int argc, char *argv[]) {......}
</pre>

<h1>Runtime Options</h1>

<p>
Options:

<p>
<table class=dirtab>
<tr><td>-tb name
	<td>: (REQUIRED) File name of jobs-list
<tr><td>-ot n
	<td>: Position of output file name in the job-data list
<tr><td>-pg name
	<td>: Application name
<tr><td>-rt _
	<td>: (not used; it is for fault tolerance)
<tr><td>-wl _
	<td>: (not used; it is for fault tolerance)
<tr><td>-lg name
	<td>: Log-file name (default as "mpidp.log")
</table>

<h1>Jobs-List Table</h1>

<p>
Jobs-list table consists of a title (TITLE), an argument list (PARAM),
and tab-separated lines of job-data lists.

<p>
<table class=dirtab>
<tr><td>TITLE=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
	<td>: (OPTIONAL) Title Line (any string)
<tr><td>PARAM=arg1 arg2 arg3 ...
	<td>: (REQUIRED) Argument List to Main Procedure (argc/argv)
<tr><td>job1-data1 \t job1-data2 \t job1-data3 ...
	<td>: (REQUIRED) Job-data List (one line corresponds to one job)
<tr><td>job2-data1 \t job2-data2 \t job2-data3 ...
	<td>
<tr><td>job3-data1 \t job3-data2 \t job3-data3 ...
	<td>
<tr><td>...
	<td>
</table>
ï¿¼
<p>
The title line (TITLE) indicates a title, and can be any (short)
string.

<p>
The argument list (PARAM) forms a skeleton of arguments to the main
procedure, where it is appended after the command line arguments.  It
may include variable references like "$i", where they are substituted
by the corresponding ones in the job-data list.  Job-data list is a
tab-separated line of words, and the first word replaces "$1", and so
on.

<p>
Each line of job-data lists makes up a task.  Fields in a job-data
list will replace the variables in the argument list, where the fields
are separated by tabs.

<h1>Jobs-List Example</h1>

<p>
An example jobs-list file "testdp.table" be look like the following:

<pre class="fragment">
TITLE=Example Run
PARAM=aln -i $1 -d $2 -o $3 -a 2 -w 0 -q d -t p -L 2097152 -S 8 -v 1 -b 1 -s 1 -T 30
xaa	genes.db	out.0
xab     genes.db	out.1
xac     genes.db	out.2
xad     genes.db	out.3
</pre>

<p>
"$1" is substituted by "xaa", "$2" by "genes.db", and "$3" by "out.0",
and so on, similarly for each following lines.

<h1>Example Run</h1>

<p>
A run can be started with:

<pre class="fragment">
mpirun -np n a.out -tb testdp.table
</pre>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>
KMR-DP is included in KMR.

<h1>Simplest Usage</h1>

<pre class="fragment">
sed -e 's/main/application/' < app.c > appnew.c
mpic++ appnew.c libkmr.a
mpiexec a.out -tb testdp.table
</pre>

<h1>Logging Output</h1>

<p>
A logging file ("mpidp.log" by default) dumps run information.  The
fields of "JOB table" and "Worker table" indicate the result.

<p>
The "JOB table" lists results one line for each task.  "WID" is
identical to the task number (in KMR-DP case, with no retry).

<p>
The "Worker table" lists results one line for each rank.  Fields of
each line indicate: 1st: rank, 2nd: number of tasks, and the following
consists two columns for each task result.  Each task result
indicates: 1st: a task number, and 2nd: a return value.
